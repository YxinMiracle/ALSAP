situations O
the O

For O
cross-site B-relevant_term

Web O

scenario O
Successful O
exploitation O

requires O
that O

 O

the O
severity O

exploitation O
of O
a O
vulnerability O
. O

The O
following O
mitigating O
factors O
may O
be O
helpful O
in O
your O
situation O
: O
An O
attacker O
who O
successfully O
exploited O
this O
vulnerability O
could O
gain B-relevant_term
the O
same O
user O
rights O
as O
the O
local B-relevant_term
user O
. O

Users O
whose O
accounts O
are O
configured O
to O
have O
fewer O
user O
rights O
on O
the O
system O
could O
be O
less O
impacted O
than O
users O
who O
operate O
with O
administrative O
user O
rights O
. O

There O
are O
two O
types O
of O
systems O
at O
risk O
from O
this O
vulnerability O
 O
described O
as O
follows O
: O
systems O
that O
are O
using O
the O
web O
browsing O
scenario O
and O
systems O
that O
are O
using O
the O
Windows B-os
.NET B-application
Framework I-application
applications O
scenario O
. O

Web O
browsing O
scenario O
Successful O
exploitation O
of O
this O
vulnerability O
requires O
that O
a O
user O
is O
logged O
on O
and O
is O
visiting O
websites O
using O
a O
web O
browser O
capable O
of O
instantiating O
XBAPs O
. O

Therefore O
 O
any O
systems O
where O
a O
web O
browser O
is O
used O
frequently O
 O
such O
as O
workstations O
or O
terminal O

 O
are O
at O
the O
most O
risk O
from O
this O
vulnerability O
. O

Servers O
could O
be O
at O
more O
risk O
if O
administrators O
allow O
users O
to O
browse O
and O

. O

However O
 O

practices O
strongly O
discourage O

An O
attacker O
could O
host O
a O

a O

The O
attacker O
could O
also O
take O

In O
all O
cases O
 O
however O
 O
an O

would O
have O
no O
way O

: O
An O

There O
are O
two O
types O
of O
systems O
at O
risk O
from O
this O
vulnerability O
 O
described O
as O
follows O
: O
systems O
that O
are O

scenario O
and O
systems O
that O
are O

Windows B-os

scenario O
. O

Web O
browsing O
scenario O
Successful O
exploitation O
of O
this O
vulnerability O
requires O
that O
a O
user O
is O
logged O
on O
and O
is O
visiting O
websites O
using O
a O
web O
browser O
capable O
of O

Therefore O
 O
any O
systems O
where O
a O

browser O
is O
used O
frequently O
 O
such O
as O
workstations O

 O
are O
at O
the O
most O
risk O
from O
this O
vulnerability O

Servers O
could O
be O
at O
more O
risk O
if O

 O

In O
a O

 O
an O

could O
also O
exploit O
this O
vulnerability O
by O
running O

However O
 O
the O
attacker O
must O

In O
